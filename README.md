## The Areas

#### 1. Tests
I need to work on tests more, this is what I have least amount of experience in in terms of rails components. TDD is mostly used now a days as a standard for writing quality and scalable code.
1.a I could add tests to my already existing projects for the experience and practice.
1.b Read and research more about writing tests.

#### 2. Opensource
I should pick up some open source projects, reading the code will give more insight into better practices and writing code. Understanding code written by other people and different types of approaches will broaden my vision. Maybe even contribute to the project. Maybe pick something from http://www.opensourcerails.com/ or I was wondering if you could recommend a good opensource project?
2.a Read 2-3 opensource projects and understand the project code.
2.b Analyze the code, think of alternatives and improvements that could be made.
2.c Contribute to the projects if possible.

#### 3. Documentation
Haven't really did any or felt the need of documentation so far but that is also an essential thing to do. Writing about and explaining your code may improve even my understanding of it and improve it. I do have a blog but there isn't much on it. Work Record
3.a Read documentation from other projects.
3.b Document existing projects.
3.c Write more blog posts about different topics.

#### 4. Rewrite existing projects
I could rewrite existing projects, refactor the code, improve it, with more tests, comments and documentation, use better structure and practices, some of the older files may be crass.
4.a After reading and analyzing the opensource projects, I could gain insight into better practices or improvements that could be made into my own code.
4.b Rewrite the projects with the above upgrades.
